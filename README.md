# hash
Simple implementation of hashing algorithms

## Motivation

Implement most commont hashing algorithms in a form of modern C++ code without unnecessary dependencies.

## Further work

[X] Implement MD5
[ ] Implement SHA256
[ ] Allow for generict types for input data
[ ] Add templated version of from_string
[ ] Add possibility to compute hash of a file
